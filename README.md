# Send Ethereum Transactions

Simple webapp to send Ethereum transactions using MetaMask. Includes ENS support on the mainnet. The components used to make this are useful templates for dapp interfaces. Uses [Quasar Framework](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar) as the foundation, along with [vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) for state management, and [vue-router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) for routing. The included [web3](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js) version is 1.0.0-beta.26.

Live version of this webapp is hosted on Netlify: https://sendethtx.netlify.com/
